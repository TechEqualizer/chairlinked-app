# Template 8 Design System

This design system provides a comprehensive set of components, tokens, and utilities for building consistent and visually appealing interfaces within the Template 8 application.

## Core Principles

1. **Consistency** - Maintain visual and behavioral consistency across the application
2. **Flexibility** - Components should be adaptable to different contexts and requirements
3. **Accessibility** - Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
4. **Performance** - Optimize for speed and efficiency
5. **Maintainability** - Well-documented, modular code that's easy to update

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system. They're used to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

### Colors

The color system is built around a primary brand color with supporting colors for different states and purposes:

- **Primary** - Main brand color, used for primary actions and key UI elements
- **Secondary** - Complementary color used for secondary actions and accents
- **Neutral** - Grayscale colors for text, backgrounds, and borders
- **Success** - Indicates successful actions or positive states
- **Warning** - Indicates warnings or cautionary states
- **Error** - Indicates errors or destructive actions

Each color has a range of shades from 50 (lightest) to 950 (darkest).

### Typography

The typography system includes:

- **Font Families** - Sans-serif, serif, and monospace options
- **Font Sizes** - Consistent scale from xs to 9xl
- **Font Weights** - Range from thin to black
- **Line Heights** - Options from tight to loose
- **Letter Spacing** - Options from tight to wide

### Spacing

The spacing system is based on a 4px grid (0.25rem) to ensure consistent spacing throughout the application.

### Borders & Shadows

Consistent border radii and shadow definitions for depth and elevation.

## Components

The design system includes a comprehensive set of components:

- **Layout** - Container, Section, Grid, Flex
- **Typography** - Heading, Text, Label
- **Inputs** - Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Radio
- **Feedback** - Alert, Toast, Progress
- **Navigation** - Tabs, Breadcrumb, Pagination
- **Surfaces** - Card, Dialog, Drawer
- **Data Display** - Table, List, Badge
- **Media** - Avatar, Image, Icon
- **Overlay** - Modal, Popover, Tooltip
- **Advanced** - GlassMorphism, Carousel

## Usage

Import components and tokens from the design system:

```tsx
import { 
  Button, 
  Card, 
  Heading, 
  Text, 
  colors, 
  spacing 
} from '@/components/template8/design-system';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Card elevation="md" isHoverable>
      <Heading size="xl" color={colors.primary[700]}>
        Welcome to Template 8
      </Heading>
      <Text size="md" color={colors.neutral[600]}>
        This is a sample component using the design system.
      </Text>
      <Button variant="primary" size="lg">
        Get Started
      </Button>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

## Theming

The design system supports light and dark themes, as well as custom theme variants for different sections of the application.

## Accessibility

All components are designed with accessibility in mind, including:

- Proper contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Focus management
- ARIA attributes

## Responsive Design

Components are built to be responsive by default, with appropriate breakpoints and mobile-first design principles.
